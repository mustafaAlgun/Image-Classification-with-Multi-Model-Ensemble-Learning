## About The Repo


In this repo, 

* You will find a Jupyter Notebook file that you can use as a step-by-step guide. Every step is explained thoroughly in the notebook.

* Two custom design CNNs (Sequential and Attention-based) are trained and evaluated.

## Getting Started

This Jupyter Notebook was written in Python & Tensorflow. You can directly download the notebook and run it locally, or you can upload it on Google Collabs and run there (I recommend GPU usage for faster training time). <br />

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.



### Installation

Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mustafaAlgun/Image-Classification-with-Multi-Model-Ensemble-Learning.git
```
### Dataset

Dataset can be downloaded from [this link](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/jctsfj2sfn/1).

## Usage

This is a walk-through Jupyter Notebook. Therefore, following the steps and reading comments will be more than enough for you to replicate the results :) Mind you, you may need to change the paths of files according to where they are in your local machine.


## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/mustafaAlgun/mage-Classification-with-Multi-Model-Ensemble-Learning/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to be learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.
* If you have suggestions for adding or removing projects, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/mustafaAlgun/Covid-19-Detection-with-Vision-Transformer/issues/new) to discuss it, or directly create a pull request after you edit the *README.md* file with necessary changes.
* Please make sure you check your spelling and grammar.
* Create individual PR for each suggestion.
